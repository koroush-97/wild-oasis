🏝️ The Wild Oasis

The Wild Oasis is a modern, fast, and fully interactive admin dashboard designed for managing hotel operations such as reservations, customers, cabins, and overall business statistics. Built with React and powered by Vite, the project focuses on performance, clean architecture, and a smooth user experience.

The app connects to Supabase, which handles authentication, database storage, and API operations. Server-state and asynchronous workflows are managed efficiently using TanStack React Query, ensuring data stays fresh, consistent, and optimized with minimal manual handling.

The interface is styled using Styled Components, giving the project a scalable and flexible design system. Forms are built with React Hook Form, making them performant and easy to validate, while React Hot Toast provides elegant notifications that enhance the user experience. Navigation is handled through React Router v6, allowing seamless transitions between pages, and potential runtime errors are captured gracefully thanks to React Error Boundary.

Additionally, the dashboard includes visual data insights using Recharts, making it easy for administrators to understand performance trends and analytics at a glance. The development environment is kept clean with a full ESLint setup alongside vite-plugin-eslint, ensuring high code quality throughout the project.

Overall, The Wild Oasis is a well-structured, production-ready React application that demonstrates modern best practices, modular architecture, and strong integration with cloud services. It’s suitable both as a real-life admin tool and as a portfolio project showcasing professional-level front-end engineering.
